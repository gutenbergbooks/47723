Young Zuan Gradenigo</h2>


<p>Evil tidings have their own trick
of spreading abroad. You cannot
bury them. The news which had
come secretly to Venice was known
from the Giudecca to Madonna dell'Orto
in two hours. Before noon it
was in Murano.</p>

<p>Young Zuan Gradenigo, making his
way on foot from the crowded Merceria<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
into the Piazza di San Marco,
ran upon his friend, the young German
captain, whom men called Il
Lupo&mdash;his name was W&ouml;lfart&mdash;and
learned, what almost every other man
in the city already knew, how Lewis
of Hungary, taking excuse of a merchant
ship looted in Venetian waters,
was on his way to a second invasion,
and had given over the Dalmatian
towns to the ban of Bosnia to ravage.</p>

<p>The two men were still eagerly discussing
the matter and its probable
outcome, half an hour later, standing
beside one of the gayly painted booths
which, at this time&mdash;the spring of
1355&mdash;were clustered about the foot
of the great Campanile, when a servant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
in the livery of the doge touched
young Zuan's arm and, in a low tone,
gave him a message.</p>

<p>Gradenigo turned back to the German.</p>

<p>"My uncle wishes to see me at once
in the palace," he said. "If you are
not pressed, go to my house and wait
for me there. I may have important
news for you." Then, with a
parting wave of the hand, he went
quickly across the Piazzetta and under
the gateway to the right of St.
Mark's.</p>

<p>At the head of the great stair two
men were awaiting him, and they
led him at once through a narrow
passage with secret sliding-doors to
an inner cabinet of the private apartments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
of the newly elected doge, his
uncle, Giovanni Gradenigo.</p>

<p>The doge sat alone in a great
carven chair before a table which was
littered with papers and with maps
and with writing-materials. From a
high window at one side colored beams
of light slanted down and rested
in crimson and blue splashes upon
the dark oak of the table and what lay
there, and upon the rich velvet of the
doge's robe, and upon his peculiar
cap of office. He was not a very old
man, but he was far from strong.
Indeed, even at this time he was
slowly wasting away with the disease
which carried him off a year later,
but as he sat there, bowed before the
table, he looked old and very worn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
and tired. His face had no color at
all. It was like a dead man's face&mdash;cold
and damp.</p>

<p>And yet, although he was ill and
seemed quite unfit for labors or duties
of any sort, he was in reality an unusually
keen and shrewd man, capable
of unremitting toil. There burned
somewhere within the shrunken, pallid
body an astonishingly fierce flame of
life. He had been elected to office
hard upon the Faliero catastrophe
partly because his name was one of the
very greatest in Venice&mdash;two others of
his house had worn the cap and ring
within the century past&mdash;but chiefly
because his sympathies were as remote
as possible from the liberal views
of the poor old man who had preceded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
him. He was patrician before all else,
and fiercely tenacious of patrician
rights&mdash;fiercely proud of his name and
possessions.</p>

<p>He did not move as his nephew entered
the room, only his pale eyes rose
slowly to the young man's face and
as slowly dropped again to the table
before him. Young Zuan pulled forward
one of the heavy, uncomfortable
chairs of carved wood and sat down in
it. He was wondering very busily
what his uncle wanted of him, but he
knew the old man too well to ask questions.
Besides that, it would not have
been respectful.</p>

<p>Presently the pale eyes rose again.</p>

<p>"You have&mdash;heard?" asked the
doge, in his thin voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>Young Zuan nodded.</p>

<p>"It is all over Venice," he said. "That
Angevin devil Lewis is coming westward
again, and, to begin with, has set
his friend the ban on Zara and Spalato.
He chose his time well, God knows!"
He paused a moment as if in expectation
of comment, but old Giovanni's
face was a death-mask, immobile, and
he went on: "As Il Lupo, the German
captain, said to me a quarter of an
hour ago, 'Venice is a very sick man&mdash;poison
within, wounds without.' We
shall lose Dalmatia."</p>

<p>Old Giovanni nodded once or twice,
and for a moment he closed his pale
eyes, sitting quite motionless in his
great chair. It was as if he ceased even
to breathe. Then, quite suddenly, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
eyes snapped open and a swift flame
of rage seemed to leap up in the old
man, amazing in its unexpectedness.
A momentary patch of crimson glowed
upon each of the gray cheeks.</p>

<p>"That dog may have Dalmatia," he
cried, "but, by God and by my ring of
office! I'm damned if he shall have
Arbe! I won't give up Arbe! I want
to die there!"</p>

<p>Now Arbe needs a very brief word of
comment. It was, and is, one of the
northern Dalmatian islands&mdash;a tiny
island, claw-fashioned, ten miles long,
perhaps, not more than a mile wide at
its thickest. It is hemmed about by
greater isles&mdash;Veglia to the north,
Cherso and Lussin Grande to the west,
Pago to the south. Eastward the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
high, bare, rocky rampart of the
Croatian hills rises sheer from the sea,
almost throwing its shadow over the
island that nestles under it. The northern
expanse of Arbe is wooded, but at
the extremity of one south-stretching
claw sits a city in miniature.</p>

<p>It was at this time, and had been for
more than a century, a summer resort
for several of the great Venetian families,
who had built there villas and
campanili and churches as beautiful
as anything beside the Grand Canal,
though no more beautiful than those of
the true, native, Arbesan families, such
as the De Dominis and Nemira and
Zudeneghi. As a witness that I do not
lie, you may see the ruins of them even
now&mdash;magnificent ruins, dwelt in by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
horde of fishermen. And among these
great families, by far the foremost had
been the Gradenigo. There were three
Gradenigo villas, cloistered and courtyarded,
which were magnificent enough
to be called palaces; a Gradenigo had,
early in the thirteenth century, built
the highest and finest of the four campanili&mdash;it
still stands; a Gradenigo
had been several times count of the
island. Hence, as you see, Arbe was
peculiarly a Gradenigo pride. It was
the apple of their eye. Hence also you
will comprehend old Giovanni's sudden
flare of rage. His withered heart
was wrung with fear. He saw, I have
no doubt, hideous visions of the ban's
barbarians slaying, looting, wielding
torch and hammer in his fairy-land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>Young Zuan looked up with new
concern.</p>

<p>"A-ah!" he said, half under his
breath. "Arbe!&mdash;I had not thought
of Arbe." His tone took on a shade of
doubt.</p>

<p>"Is it likely," he wondered, aloud,
"that the ban will go out of his way
to attack the island? It's of no value
whatever, strategically. It would be
mere wanton vandalism."</p>

<p>"And what," snarled old Giovanni,
"is that mongrel Bosnian but a vandal?
'Likely,' say you? It is more than
that. The dog has sworn to take Arbe
and give it to that Magyar strumpet of
his, Yaga. He knows nothing would
hurt me more. He went about Zara,
a week ago, boasting openly of what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
he meant to do&mdash;so the word
comes."</p>

<p>Young Zuan flushed red and cursed
under his breath.</p>

<p>"That is beyond bearing!" he said.
"That woman in Arbe? That shameless,
thieving wanton who stole away
Natalia Volutich?"</p>

<p>The doge nodded, licking his blue
lips. "The same," he said. "The ban's
Yaga would appear to have a grudge
against the house of Gradenigo."</p>

<p>About a year before this time, for
the sake of cementing a closer union
between the two republics, a marriage
had been arranged between young
Zuan Gradenigo and the daughter of
the Ragusan Senator Volutich. But
before Zuan had reached Ragusa to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
make his visit of ceremony and see his
prospective bride, the girl, riding with
her women a little way beyond the
land gate of the town, had been stolen
by brigands. Such things were by no
means extraordinary. Nothing had
been heard of her since, save that, a
fortnight after her capture, a letter,
couched in most insulting terms, had
come to Ragusa from the Princess
Yaga, that infamous favorite of the
ban, saying that the girl was in her
household and somewhat preferred it
to her former home.</p>

<p>"It's beyond bearing!" said young
Zuan again, and he was so angry that
his voice shook. Then, after the two
had for a moment stared into each
other's eyes, he threw out his hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
with a little laugh of sheer exasperation.</p>

<p>"But what can we do?" he cried.
"Madonna Santissima, what can we
do? With this war upon our hands
the council will never consent to sending
aid to Arbe, which is, after all, of
importance to only a few families."</p>

<p>"They <em>must</em> consent!" said the doge,
fiercely. "I will not lose Arbe! Look
you! Who are the families concerned?
Loredan, Morosini, Dandolo, Celsi, Venier,
Contarini, Corner. All of them
members of the Ten. I will see them,
and, among us, we shall be able to arrange
it. The thing must remain a
private matter. We who love Arbe
must go to Arbe's aid unofficially.
Three galleys will suffice. They must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
leave to-night, and the council must
not know of it until after they have
sailed."</p>

<p>Young Zuan looked up with a certain
awe, for the scheme, when one
considered the state of internal affairs
in Venice at that time, was almost
madness.</p>

<p>"It is a desperate plan," he said,
gravely. "You must feel very deeply
to risk such a scheme, after the Faliero
affair."</p>

<p>Old Giovanni Gradenigo beat his yellow
hand upon the table before him,
and once again the two spots of color
came out upon his sunken cheeks.</p>

<p>"I will not lose Arbe!" he cried for
the third time. "Leave the risk and
the arrangements to me. As for you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Zuan, you must go at the head of the
expedition. I want a Gradenigo to
rescue my island, and you are the only
one of the house who is experienced in
warfare."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, of course I should go," said
Zuan. "I have the best right." He
rose to take his leave. "I shall have a
busy day of it," he said, "but I can
have the three galleys ready before
midnight, and secretly at that. I shall
take Il Lupo with me. He is very
faithful and a better man than I.
When shall I come to you for instructions
and authority? I must
have authority to clear the galleys, of
course."</p>

<p>"Come to-night when I send for
you," said the doge. "Everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
shall be ready for you." He had sunk
wearily back in his great chair once
more, and all signs of life had faded
from his face. It seemed to his nephew
that he looked more than ever like a
dead man. He raised one feeble hand
a little way as if in sign of dismissal,
but the hand dropped back upon the
carved wood of the chair-arm with a
sort of dry rattle, and Zuan left him so,
still, silent, deathly, with the bars of
colored light from the high window
slanting across his velvet robes in billets
and lozenges of vert and gules and
azure.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The three galleys which slipped
gently out of the canal of the Giudecca
that night bore southward before a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
favoring maestrale. Of one galley
young Zuan Gradenigo held the command,
of another the German called
Il Lupo, and of the third a Venetian
captain whose name does not matter.
By noon of the next day they were off
Lussin Grande, and hove to, well out
of sight of land, to await the darkness.
They saw during the day nothing to
disturb them. No ship passed save a
Venetian fishing-boat or two, high-prowed
and with colored triangular
sails painted with some device; also,
in the afternoon, three great trabacoli
south bound from Trieste or Pola, bluff-bowed
craft, with hawse-ports painted
to represent ferocious eyes.</p>

<p>Towards evening the maestrale died
away, as it so often does in these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
waters, and from the south a sirocco
arose, bringing a rack of clouds over
the sky and a heavy dampness to the
air. Before dark it was freshening fast
and a fine rain was beginning to drive.
The three galleys pitched and plunged
heavily in the mounting sea. Young
Gradenigo signalled to the two other
ships, and, leading the way himself, ran
for the southern point of Lussin. He
knew that, once within the shelter of
the islands and scoglie, he would be
well out of danger, for there is never a
sea there, even though a storm may
be raging outside.</p>

<p>By the time he reached the tranquil
shelter between Lussin and Pago the
night had fallen, black dark. It rained
in spells, but once in a while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
driving rack overhead parted for a
moment and a flash of moonlight came
down. Young Zuan ordered the galley
brought to, and waited for one of these
momentary floods of light. The light
came, touching with silver the great,
tumbling seas outside the barrier reef,
but the seas were empty. There were
no galleys making for the southern
point of Lussin. Gradenigo turned with
an oath of surprise to the old sailing-master
who stood beside him, sheltering
his eyes from the wind with one
brown hand.</p>

<p>"They have been driven northward,"
he said. "They'll have to run between
Cherso and the main-land and beat
south again by Veglia." The sailing-master
shook his head gloomily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is a bad night, lord," said he.
"That sea will be hell in another
hour." And he moved off forward to
give orders to his men.</p>

<p>There seemed nothing for it but to
go on, and, in the sheltered cove at the
north of Arbe, where the disembarkment
was to take pace, await the other
ships. Young Zuan felt no great
anxiety over them; he was sure that
they had merely been driven northward,
and would have to round Cherso,
and then make their way down again
through the sheltered "canal" between
that island and Veglia. His only fear
was that they might not reach Arbe
before morning, in which case the relief
of the city&mdash;granting always that
the ban's expedition had already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
occupied it&mdash;would have to be delayed
until another night.</p>

<p>He put about again, and, running
before the strong sirocco (the wind, of
course, reaches these sheltered waters,
somewhat abated, though there is no
sea), made out the lights of Arbe within
two hours. In another hour, leaving
the galley well to the west of the
island and hidden in the gloom, he was
in a skiff, rowed by two strong sailor-men,
creeping round the walls of the
city.</p>

<p>Now it has been said that the city
occupies a southward-jutting claw of
rock. The villas and streets, indeed,
crowd to the very edge of the narrow
ridge. On the western side the sea-wall,
a hundred feet high, rises sheer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
from the water, and is continued upward
by the walls of the buildings.
Eastward, however, round the point,
the land slopes lower, and here is a
sheltered cove in the crook of the rocky
claw, with a mole and landing-place
of hewn stone. Upon the landing-place
opens a public square.</p>

<p>Young Zuan in his skiff crept round
the point, and, always under the shelter
of the sea-wall, into the still harbor
where was the landing-place. Fifty
yards from the point where the sea-wall
dropped to the water's level and
the open square began, he halted. From
the wall near by lion heads of carved
stone projected, and in each beast's
mouth hung a great bronze ring for
mooring ships. One of the two sailor-men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
laid hold of a ring and held the
skiff steady, and Zuan rose to his feet
to look.</p>

<p>Far over his head the wind&mdash;driving
a thin rain before it once more&mdash;shrieked
and whistled past the roofs of
Arbe, and flapped the gay awnings
which hung over the marble balconies.
Once, above the wind's noise, a woman's
shriek rose and held and then
died suddenly. Beyond, in the open
square, a great fire blazed on the flags,
and hurrying men in strange dress
threw armfuls of fuel upon it. Others
held hands and danced about the fire
in a ring, like devils, singing a weird
and wild chant. It was a fine chant
and stirring, and these Huns sang it
well, but to young Zuan Gradenigo's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
ears it was the baying of unclean
dogs.</p>

<p>He dropped back upon the thwart
of his skiff with a sobbing curse. The
ban's Magyar strumpet was set where
the ban had sworn to set her.</p>

<p>"Row to the galley!" he said, and as
the two sailor-men bent to their work,
standing at their oars gondolier fashion,
and the skiff leaped forward through
the wet gloom, he laid his face in his
hands and it twisted and worked bitterly.
He was by no means a coward,
and he was not a particularly
imaginative man, but the picture of
that leaping fire and the leaping, chanting
devils about it persisted before his
eyes, and he looked forward to the
struggle which was to come, and an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
odd premonition of disaster took possession
of him and would not be driven
away.</p>

<p>In the tiny sheltered cove of rendezvous,
two miles above the city, they
anchored the galley and disembarked.
There is a rocky headland beside the
cove, high at its outer end, and here
certain trusty officers took their station,
with lanterns muffled in their cloaks, to
watch for the approach of the other
two ships. Young Zuan went within a
deserted fisherman's hut which stood
where wood and beach met, and there
held council with his sailing-master
and his chief lieutenant. He was still
strong in the belief that Il Lupo's ship
and the other were safe and would
arrive in a few hours&mdash;it was by now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
somewhat after midnight&mdash;but the old
sailing-master again shook a gloomy
head. He had served Venice for forty
years on land and sea, and he was a
pessimist.</p>

<p>There arose cries and shoutings without,
and a petty officer burst into the
hut, puffed with importance and
pride.</p>

<p>"Prisoners, lord!" he reported.
"Three spies caught skulking and
peeping in the wood."</p>

<p>"Bring them in!" said young Zuan.
"And keep those men quiet outside.
Do you wish the whole island to know
we are here?"</p>

<p>The prisoners were thrust into the
room&mdash;great, squat, hairy fellows in
the barbaric dress of Huns, surly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
villanous. They would not speak.
It was evident that they understood
neither Italian nor Greek, and they
affected not to comprehend the sailing-master's
halting efforts at their own
tongue. They only stared under their
shaggy brows, silent and stolid, and
tugged at the hands which were bound
behind them.</p>

<p>"Are these men?" cried out young
Zuan, in fine Venetian scorn. "Take
the cattle away! Bind their feet and
set a guard over them. Hark! What
is that?"</p>

<p>That was a woman's scream from
without, low and very angry.</p>

<p>"But a woman, lord," explained the
officer who had brought in the prisoners&mdash;"a
young wench who was prowling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
with these fellows and was taken with
them. Asking your lordship's pardon,
I thought it idle to bring her to you&mdash;a
common wench."</p>

<p>"Take these men away," said young
Gradenigo, "and bring in the woman.
It may be that she speaks a Christian
tongue."</p>

<p>She crept into the hut, pressing
against the side of the doorway, and
stood against the farther wall&mdash;a girl, a
mere slip of a girl, with her long brown
hair down over her eyes. And there
against the wall she stood, shaking, her
hands twisting together over her breast,
and her eyes, like the eyes of a hunted,
cornered animal, went swiftly from one
face to another of the men across the
room, and finally settled upon the face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
of Zuan Gradenigo, and did not stir for
a long time.</p>

<p>She stood in her thin white shift,
and on her bared arms were marks as
if rough hands and none too clean had
been there.</p>

<p>When young Zuan spoke his voice
was gentle and kindly, the maid was
so sore beset, so full of fear, so alone.</p>

<p>"Do you&mdash;understand Italian?" he
asked. The maid did not answer him,
but when she spoke she spoke in perfectly
fluent Venetian dialect&mdash;as good
Venetian as Gradenigo's own. And
the fear seemed to go from her, giving
place to anger.</p>

<p>"My garments, lord!" she said, and
laid her bruised arms across her bosom
in a little, pitiful gesture of outraged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
modesty. "Your men have taken
them from me. I am ashamed, lord.
They&mdash;laid their foul hands on my
arms." Her face twisted as at the
memory of insult, and the lieutenant
who stood across the room laughed
aloud. Young Zuan turned upon him
fiercely.</p>

<p>"Hold your laughter for a fitter excuse!"
he said. "Are we Huns, to
insult women? Go out to those men
and find the maid's garments. Bring
them here." The man went, staring,
and, at a motion of Gradenigo's head,
the sailing-master followed him, leaving
the two alone.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, child," said Zuan Gradenigo.
"We did not come here to ill-treat
women. I shall see that my men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
are punished for what they have done.
Meanwhile&mdash;" He took up the mantle
which he had put aside over a near-by
bench, and, crossing the room, laid it
over the girl's shoulders. It covered
her almost to the feet. And when he
had done this he stood, for what he
imagined to be a moment, looking
down into the eyes that held his so
steadily&mdash;brave eyes, unafraid, unclouded,
unwavering. One could not
be harsh or cruel in the gaze of such&mdash;even
though they looked from the face
of an enemy. An enemy? Nonsense!
A girl taken by chance as she wandered
through the wood&mdash;as she peeped, full
of childish curiosity, at the disembarkment
of a ship's load of soldiers.
Brave eyes, unafraid. That was why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
they held him so, because they fronted
him without fear&mdash;even with
trust.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 399px;">
<a id="LAID"><img src="images/i_032fp.jpg" width="399" height="600" alt="" /></a>
<div class="caption">HE LAID THE MANTLE OVER THE GIRL'S SHOULDERS</div>
</div>



<p>Ay, doubtless that was why they
held him so, and yet&mdash;He stirred
restlessly. Such great eyes! With
such illimitable depths! How came a
wandering child by such eyes? They
moved him oddly. The child would
seem to be an uncommon child. Those
steady, burning eyes of hers had some
uncommon power, worked some strange
spell, some sorcery, not evil, but unfamiliarly
sweet, unknown to his experience.</p>

<p>He gave a little, confused laugh and
raised an uncertain hand towards his
head, but the girl had, at the same moment,
put out one of her own hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
to fasten the clasp of Zuan's mantle at
her throat, and his fingers touched her
arm.</p>

<p>At that, as if it brought back her injuries
to mind, she dropped her eyes,
and the man was loosed incontinently
from his chains.</p>

<p>"Lord!" she cried again, flushing
red in the light of the lanterns, "they
put their foul hands upon me! They
put their hands upon me!" The very
present peril in which she might well
have believed herself to stand seemed
not to occur to her. It seemed that
only those rough, befouling hands were
in her mind. Her face gave once more
its little, shivering twist of anger and
repulsion.</p>

<p>"They shall be punished, child!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
said Zuan Gradenigo, between tight
lips. "Oh, they shall suffer for it, you
may be sure. And now"&mdash;he took a
turn away from her, for her great eyes
were upon him again, level and unafraid&mdash;"now
will you tell me who
you are and how you came to be found
with those barbarians to-night? Surely
you can have no traffic with such.
Surely you are a lady. I have seen
that." And indeed he had seen, while
the girl stood in her thin white shift,
how beautifully she was made&mdash;deep-bosomed,
slim-waisted, with tapering
wrists and ankles, and round white
throat. No common wench was there.
There was good blood under that white
skin of hers.</p>

<p>"Surely you are a lady," said young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Zuan, but the girl bent her head from
him.</p>

<p>"Nay, lord," she said, very low, "I
am only&mdash;a serving-maid to the Princess
Yaga."</p>

<p>The red flamed into Zuan's cheeks.</p>

<p>"That woman!" he cried. "You
serve that vile fiend in human flesh,
that royal strumpet, that wanton at
whose name men spit? <em>You?</em>" The
girl stared at him under her brows.</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Zuan Gradenigo.
"Where is God that hell could devise
such a wrong? What was God doing
that you should stray into such clutches
and He not know? That&mdash;that monster
of vice and uncleanness!" He
pointed a shaking hand towards the
south.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>"There she sits," said he, "polluting
the castle where Jacopo Corner has sat
for so many years, where my grandfather
sat before him, and his father
before him. There she sits gloating;
but, by God and St. Mark's lion! before
this week is over I shall tear her
head from her body and throw it to
the dogs. Nay! better than that! I
shall send it, in the name of Venice, to
the ban who sent her here to shame
us."</p>

<p>"Lord!" said the maid, very low&mdash;"lord!
Oh, you do not know! You&mdash;speak
wildly. You do not know what
you say."</p>

<p>"I know," said Zuan Gradenigo,
"that all I say is true. That woman's
name is infamous throughout Europe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
It is a name of scorn. It means all that
is vile&mdash;as you must know. Will Arbe
ever be clean from her&mdash;even when
we have washed its stones with her
blood? But <em>you</em>!" he cried, in a new
voice. "Oh, child, that <em>you</em> should
have to serve her&mdash;be near to her! I
cannot think of it with calmness."</p>

<p>The maid turned a little away from
him and moved over to the wooden
bench where Zuan's mantle had lain.
And she seated herself at one end of
the bench, looking across the room at
him very soberly.</p>

<p>"And why not I, lord," she asked,
"as well as another? What do you
know of me? I am&mdash;a serving-maid,
and such must serve whomever they
may." He came nearer and stared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
into her face, and his own was oddly
troubled, frowning.</p>

<p>"I cannot think of you&mdash;so," he said.
"A serving-maid? There's something
strange here. Oh, child, you have
something about you&mdash;I cannot say
what it is, for I have no words. I fight,
I am not a poet, but were I such, I
think&mdash;your eyes&mdash;their trick of looking&mdash;their&mdash;I
cannot say what I mean.
A serving-maid? Oh, child, you are
fitter for velvets and jewels! I do not
understand. Something breathes from
you," he said, with that trouble upon
his frowning face, an odd trouble in his
eyes&mdash;bewildered, uncomprehending&mdash;like
a child's eyes before some mystery.
"Something breathes from you. I do
not know what it is."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>The maid looked at him in the yellow,
flickering lantern-light, and she made
as though she would speak, but in the
end shook her head and turned it a
little aside, and sat once more silent.
And for a time the man also was silent,
watching her averted face and thinking
how amazingly beautiful it was;
not white with the pallor which the
Venetian women so prized, but sumptuously
rich of color, sun-kissed, free,
unashamed of the wholesome blood
which flowed under its golden skin and
stained it with red on either cheek. He
found himself possessed of a mad
desire to touch that cheek which was
nearest him with his finger, and the
sheer folly, the childishness of the
thought would in any other mood have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
shaken a laugh of scorn from him. He
was not a woman's man, as he had said,
but a fighter.</p>

<p>One of the maid's hands stirred in
her lap and dropped beside her on the
wooden bench. The lantern-light fell
upon it&mdash;long, slender, tapering.</p>

<p>"Your hand, child!" said young
Zuan. "It is not the hand of a serving-maid.
It has never done rough
tasks."</p>

<p>"My princess is kind to me, lord,"
she said. "My tasks are easy."</p>

<p>He put out an uncertain hand and
touched the hand that lay in the
lantern-light. The maid drew a little,
quick, gasping breath, and her eyes
turned to him, great and dark. Then,
like two silly, half-grown children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
caught holding hands, they both flushed
red and their eyes turned aside once
more.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 396px;">
<a id="img2"><img src="images/b_065.jpg" width="396" height="600" alt="decorative image" /></a>
</div>

<p>Zuan raised a hand to his temples,
where the blood throbbed.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;do not know what has come
over me," he said, and turned a few
steps away across the room. In a
moment he was back again, on one
knee before her.</p>

<p>"You lay a spell upon me!" he cried,
whispering into her bent face. "I am
unmanned. Strange things stir my
heart, child&mdash;mount to my head like
wine. You lay a spell upon me."</p>

<p>"No, lord," she said, very low. "I
am but a maid. I cannot work spells
or sorcery. It is only that I am alone
and beset and miserable. It is pity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
that you feel, lord. Ah, you are kind
and merciful. Lord, I&mdash;wish that I
might do you a service for the service
you have done me."</p>

<p>"Pity?" said young Zuan.</p>

<p>"Pity, lord," she said again, and to
his awkward, unskilful tongue and to
his unaccustomed hands no occupation
seemed to come, so that he knelt silent
and troubled before her in the lantern-light.</p>

<p>If it seem that enchantment came
overswiftly upon him, overprecipitately,
it must be borne in mind that
he was a soldier, wholly unused to a
woman's company, and that this girl,
young, beautiful, and in sore straits,
was brought before him in the manner
most certain to waken his chivalry&mdash;ay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
to stir his ready heart. The maid
spoke shrewdly. It was pity he felt.
But other emotions wait hard upon
pity's threshold. Further, in young
Zuan's day, love came swiftly or not at
all. It was not the day of courtship.
Love was born of a look&mdash;a smile&mdash;a
hand-touch. And such love has
wrecked empires. It is a sober truth
that no great passion was ever of slow
maturing.</p>

<p>There came from without the door
eager voices and quick steps, and the
lieutenant whom Zuan had sent to
fetch the maid's outer garments&mdash;krozet,
saruk, and girdle&mdash;burst into the
room. His eyes were round, starting
out of his head, and his face was
flushed with excitement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>"She's still here, lord?" he cried out,
almost before he had entered. "The
woman is here? You have not let
her go?" His gaze searched the hut
swiftly.</p>

<p>"She is here," said Zuan Gradenigo,
"but you will speak more respectfully.
Give me the garments!" The
man's excitement was too great to
heed reproofs. He thrust the things
he held into his master's arms.</p>

<p>"See!" he cried. "See the girdle&mdash;the
necklace&mdash;the charm she wore
about her neck! See whom we have
taken!"</p>

<p>Young Zuan looked at the jewels,
and they slipped from his fingers and
fell, flashing in the light, and lay about
his feet. He turned very slowly towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the girl, who stood against the
farther side of the wall, and his eyes
were once more like a child's eyes&mdash;bewildered,
hurt, uncomprehending.
He stretched out a hand towards her,
and the hand shook and wavered.</p>

<p>"It is the princess herself!" cried the
lieutenant. "It is Yaga!" and fell
into a chattering, hysterical laugh.</p>

<p>"It is not&mdash;true," whispered Zuan
Gradenigo, across the little room. "Say
it is not true!" His voice rose to a
sharp, agonized appeal, but there was
no conviction in his tone. He knew.</p>

<p>At the name the girl had cried out
suddenly, and to smother the cry she
caught her two hands up to her mouth.
Even then her eyes went from one man
to the other, swift and keen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>"Say it is not true!" pleaded Zuan
Gradenigo, but the lieutenant babbled
on, stammering in his excitement.</p>

<p>"See, Messer Zuan! We have her!
We have her fast! Why not set sail at
once with her on board&mdash;at once, before
they in the city know she is taken?
Why not? See! they are helpless without
her. We can force them to give up
Arbe for her. She is worth fifty Arbes
to them&mdash;all of Dalmatia, perhaps.
Why not do that? Messer Lupo's
galley has not come, nor the other. We
can do nothing alone. Take her on
board, lord, before it is too late, and set
sail. Leave Arbe to itself for a little.
The Huns will give it up to us. Come,
come!"</p>

<p>It is doubtful if young Zuan even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
heard. His eyes, stricken and hopeless,
were upon the girl across the room,
and he whispered over and over again:</p>

<p>"Say it is not true! Say it is not
true!" But the woman's eyes were
upon the floor, and her hands dropped
to her breast, and then to her side with
a little forlorn gesture, and she bent her
head.</p>

<p>"It is true, lord," she said. "I am
the princess Yaga."</p>

<p>The lieutenant gave a great shout
and dashed out to his fellows. Young
Zuan dropped down upon the near-by
bench, covering his face.</p>

<p>Then the woman came to him, crossing
the room swiftly, and dropped upon
her knees on the floor beside him.</p>

<p>"Lord!" she said, touching his arm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
with her two hands&mdash;"lord, it would
have been of no avail to deny it. You
would have found me out in time. I
am that&mdash;dreadful woman, lord; perhaps
not so dreadful as you have
thought; perhaps men have lied about
me&mdash;made things worse than they
truly are. Still&mdash;lord&mdash;" She crept
closer to him on her knees, and her
hands pressed eagerly at his arm.
"Lord, it was wise, very wise, what
your officer begged you to do. You
have me fast&mdash;the ban's Yaga. Will
you not set sail with me and leave
Arbe? Will you not hold me hostage
for your island? The ban will give it
up to you in exchange for me. Lord,
will you not do this?" She pleaded
with him in an odd tone of eager<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
anxiety which might have aroused his
suspicions had the man been less overwhelmed
in his misery. I do not think
he heard more than the pleading voice.
I do not think he followed her words
at all.</p>

<p>"Lord!" she cried again, shaking his
arm with her two hands, "will you not
do this? It will be best for you. Oh,
far best! Listen, lord! You have been
kind to me, gentle and pitiful. You
saved me from&mdash;from great shame at
the hands of those men. You saved
me when you knew that I must be an
enemy&mdash;even though you did not know
how great an enemy&mdash;and now I am
trying to save you. You are in great
danger, lord, you and your men. <em>Will</em>
you not listen to me?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>Young Zuan raised a white face, and
his eyes looked bitterly into the woman's
eyes that burned so near.</p>

<p>"Danger?" he said, dully, under his
breath. It seemed as if he did not
care. "What danger?"</p>

<p>And then, as if his gaze held for her
some of the strange sorcery which hers
had laid upon him, the woman faltered
in her swift speech, and she gave a
little sob.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she cried. "Why did I not
know? Why did I not know?"</p>

<p>"What danger?" repeated Zuan
Gradenigo, as if the words meant
nothing to him.</p>

<p>"They know that you are here, lord,"
she said. "We knew, in the city, that
you were coming. The fishing-boat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
which passed you this morning at sea
brought us news of three galleys from
Venice. Now two of your galleys have
been blown away by the sirocco. You
are but a few men, a handful, and you
will be overwhelmed. Oh, lord, we
whom your men took to-night were
spying upon you, but there were three
more who escaped&mdash;three more men.
They will have reached the city before
this time, and you may be attacked at
any moment. Lord, <em>why</em> do you sit
there silent? Why will you not take
me on board your ship and sail
away?"</p>

<p>It came dully to Gradenigo's mind,
through the stress and whirl which obscured
it, that the maid showed a
strange eagerness, out of reason.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why do you tell me this?" he asked,
suddenly. "Why not let your barbarians
capture us&mdash;put us to death?
Why do you wish to defeat your own
cause? There's trickery here." He
rose to his feet, frowning, but the
woman was before him.</p>

<p>"If you&mdash;cannot see&mdash;lord," she
said, and a bit of bright color came into
her cheeks, "then I cannot tell you."
Suddenly she put out her two hands
upon his breast and fell to sobbing.</p>

<p>"I will not have you killed!" she
cried. "Oh, lord, I will not have you
taken or slain! For your men I care
nothing. They may die where they
stand and it will be nothing to me,
but <em>you</em>&mdash;lord, I cannot bear to have
you taken!" There was no trickery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
in that. It came from the woman's
soul, shaking her sorely.</p>

<p>Zuan looked at her, this slim, pale
girl shaken with her sobbing&mdash;this
monster of vice and sin, at whose name
men spat with derision&mdash;and again he
felt the strange, paralyzing weakness
creep over him. He could not hate
her. He turned his eyes away and
shook himself into attention.</p>

<p>"Come!" he said, "we will go. You
cannot be lying to me. We will go."</p>

<p>But before he could take a step there
arose in the night without a babel of
cries and screams and the clashing of
steel. Above it all the same strange,
barbaric chant which those devils leaping
about the fire in the landing-place
of the city had sung together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"Too late!" cried the girl. "Oh, too
late! They are here already!"</p>

<p>Zuan Gradenigo sprang silently for
his sword, which he had laid aside in a
far corner of the room, but as he did so
the woman threw herself upon the half-open
door of the hut and crashed it to,
swinging the great bar into place.</p>

<p>"You shall not go!" she said, in a
gasping whisper. "You shall not go
out there to be slain!"</p>

<p>"Out of my way!" cried Zuan, sword
in hand. "Out of my way, or by
Heaven I'll run you through! Would
you have me skulk here while my men
are fighting? Get out of my way!"
He ran at her and caught her by the
arm, swinging her aside from the door,
but the woman was back again, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
hands and knees, before he could recover
his balance. She caught him
about the knees with her arms, and
she was as strong as a young animal
and as lithe. He could not move.</p>

<p>He raised the Venetian dagger which
he held in his left hand. His eyes were
on fire.</p>

<p>"Once more," said he, "will you
stand out of my way and let me go?"
Outside, in the night, the cries and
clash of arms clamored on, and that
barbaric chant, broken sometimes,
sometimes swelling loud and triumphant,
rang over all.</p>

<p>"You shall not go through this
door!" gasped the woman, clinging
fast to young Zuan's knees. "They
are four to one out there. They would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
kill you the moment you stepped beyond
the door."</p>

<p>Strategy came to her, and she shot
out a bare arm towards the single
window.</p>

<p>"Go by the window!" she cried. "It
opens upon a thicket. They will not
see you there." She loosed him and he
sprang for the window, swinging away
the bar and pushing open the heavy
wooden shutters.</p>

<p>The woman was upon his heels as he
leaped into the night, but he did not
know or care. Through the tangle of
shrubbery and vine in which he found
himself he could see the battle raging
in the clear space of the beach beyond,
and towards it he fought his way. A
heavy creeper laid hold upon his ankles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
and, cursing savagely, he slashed at it
with his sword. A little rise of ground
was before him. He mounted it in a
single leap, and from its crest leaped
again.</p>

<p>Then he fell a long way, crashing
first through the mask of thicket
which covered a narrow ravine, striking
thence upon the earth of the farther
side and rolling down that. Once or
twice he threw out his hands to catch
himself, but as he slipped and fell
again his head struck upon something
hard&mdash;a stone, probably&mdash;and that
was the last he knew.</p>

<h2>II<br />
The Woman of Abomination</h2>


<p>When young Zuan Gradenigo came
once more to his senses after the fall in
the dark, it was like a peaceful awakening
from sweet sleep. Indeed, literally
it was just that, for from the unconsciousness
following upon the injury
to his head he had drifted easily
into slumber, so that when he waked
he had, by way of souvenir of his mishap,
scarcely even a headache.</p>

<p>That his eyes opened upon blue sky
instead of upon painted or carved ceiling
roused in him no astonishment. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
service against the Turks and against
the Genoese he had often slept in the
open, waking when the morning light
became strong enough to force its way
through his eyelids. He lay awhile,
conscious of great comfort and bodily
well-being, coming slowly and lazily
into full possession of his faculties. The
air was fresh and warm, with a scent
of thyme in it, and from somewhere
in the near distance sea-birds mewed
plaintively, after their kind. He dropped
his eyes from the pale-blue sky and
saw that though he lay upon turf&mdash;a
hill it would seem, or the crest of a cliff&mdash;there
was a stretch of tranquil sea
before him, a narrow stretch, and beyond
this a mountain range looming
sheer and barren from the water's edge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
The sun must be rising behind it, he
said to himself, for the tips of the
serrated peaks glowed golden, momentarily
brighter, so that it hurt his
eyes to watch them. He wondered
what mountains these could be, and
then, all in a flash, it came upon him
where he was&mdash;that this was Arbe, and
that ridge the Velebic mountains of the
main-land.</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 397px;">
<a id="LAY"><img src="images/i_060fp.jpg" width="397" height="600" alt="" /></a>
<div class="caption">"HE LAY AWHILE CONSCIOUS OF GREAT COMFORT"</div>
</div>

<p>His mind raced swiftly back to the
preceding evening&mdash;to the scene in the
fisherman's hut, to his dash through
the window in an attempt to join his
fighting-men, and&mdash;there he stopped.
He had a confused recollection of falling
in the dark, falling a long way, but
he was not fully awake yet, and the
effort to remember tired him. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
turned upon his side&mdash;he had been
lying on his back, with his head
pillowed upon something soft and comfortable&mdash;and,
childlike, put up an
open hand under his cheek. But when
his hand touched that upon which his
head had been resting he cried out suddenly
and struggled forthright to his
feet.</p>

<p>The woman who had saved his life
half knelt, half sat behind him, and
upon her knees his head had lain. At
this moment she was leaning back a
little, with her head and shoulders
against a small tree which stood there,
and her eyes were closed as if she were
asleep.</p>

<p>Young Zuan saw that she was very
white, and that her closed eyelids were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
blue and had blue circles under them.
The lids stirred after a moment and she
opened her eyes&mdash;blank and wondering
at first, a child's eyes, then swiftly
intelligent.</p>

<p>"Lord!" she said, in a whisper, looking
up to him&mdash;"lord, I must have&mdash;slept!
I did not know. I am sorry&mdash;lord."
She sat forward again and
made as though she would rise to her
feet, but with the first effort a spasm of
agony went over her white face, and
she gave a little scream and fell forward,
prone, and so fainted quite away.</p>

<p>For a moment young Zuan did not
understand. Then, as comprehension
came to him, he dropped upon his knees
beside the woman with an exclamation
of pity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>"The child has come near to killing
herself that I might sleep!" he cried.
Then, before she should wake to further
pain, he set skilfully to work. He
straightened the bent and cramped
knees and, with his strong hands, rubbed
and chafed the stiffened muscles.
They were cold as stone, he found, save
where his head had lain; all feeling
must long since have gone out of them.
Then at last, just as he had the blood
once more flowing redly under the skin,
the woman stirred, moving her hands
on the turf beside her, and presently
came to her senses.</p>

<p>Her eyes opened&mdash;they were not
black, as he had thought the night
before, but curiously dark blue, almost
purple&mdash;and she looked up into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
young Zuan's face as he knelt above
her.</p>

<p>"I would not&mdash;have you think me,
lord&mdash;a weakling," she said, whispering.
"It was a&mdash;moment's pain. My
knees were a little cramped. Will you
forgive me, lord?"</p>

<p>"Forgive you?" said he. "You
have saved my life. Whether that was
worth the saving or not I do not know,
but you have saved it, and you have
borne great suffering that I might sleep
in comfort. Forgive you?"</p>

<p>She lay quite still on the turf, looking
up at him, and the old, paralyzing
weakness began to creep upon Zuan's
limbs, the old, strange shaking came to
his heart.</p>

<p>"I would do it, lord," said she,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
"many, many times over for your
sake." A warm flush spread up into
her throat and over her cheeks.</p>

<p>"I do not understand," said Zuan,
stammering, and dully he thought how
beautiful she was, lying there still
before him, how young and slender and
exquisite, this woman of abomination.
"We are enemies," said he, "the bitterest
of enemies. I came here to cleanse
Arbe of you, to set your head on a spear
before the count's castle for men to
revile and spit upon."</p>

<p>"Yes, lord," said the woman of
abomination, whispering, and that
rosy flush died away from cheeks and
neck, leaving her pale again.</p>

<p>"Last night," said he, "you had me
in your power. Your men could have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
taken me alive or slain me very easily.
Yet you would not let me face them.
Even when I threatened to kill you
you would not stand out of my way."</p>

<p>"You had had me in <em>your</em> power
first, lord," said she. "But you were
kind to me. You saved me from great
shame, and covered me with your
cloak."</p>

<p>"That was nothing," said young
Zuan. "I did not know that you were
the princess Yaga. But you knew
that I was leader of the force which had
come to recover Arbe from you. Why
did you save me, princess? Why are
you here with me now in hiding? Why
are you not in the castle where you
should be?"</p>

<p>The flush came again, and for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
first time her eyes fell away from his
with a sort of timidity.</p>

<p>"I could not&mdash;leave you, lord," she
said, whispering again. "I could not
see you hurt or slain or a prisoner. And
then when, through accident, you lay
hurt, after all, I could not leave you
so."</p>

<p>"But why? Why?" he persisted,
staring down upon her with troubled
eyes. "Arbe was in the hollow of your
hand! You are the head of those barbarians
who hold the city. Yet you
desert them to succor me. Why?"</p>

<p>"If you cannot see, lord," she said,
hiding her face with her hands, "then
I cannot tell you."</p>

<p>Young Zuan gave a sudden cry.</p>

<p>"O God of Miracles!" said he, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
his breath. His heart was racing
very madly and the veins at his temples
throbbed until he thought that they
must burst.</p>

<p>He put out faltering hands and took
the woman's hands from her face.</p>

<p>"What is it," he said, "that&mdash;has
come to me to rob me of strength and
thought when I am near you? What
is it that came to me last night when
you first crept into the fisherman's hut
and I saw your eyes?"</p>

<p>"Lord," she said, very low, "I think
it is love."</p>

<p>Her hands slipped from between his
lax palms, and young Zuan got to his
feet blindly and moved a few paces
away. He put his arms up against the
trunk of a tree and laid his face upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
them. Through the whirl of things
which beset him he had a dull consciousness
that his cherished world&mdash;all
his sane, ordered life, his duty,
his ambitions, his pride of race&mdash;was
slipping from him, receding into a
misty background, leaving him face
to face with something that was immeasurably,
unthinkably great&mdash;something
for which he had been begotten
and born&mdash;something which drew him
towards itself with a might that no
puny strength of his could combat.</p>

<p>He turned, still blindly, and the
woman of abomination, slim, girlish,
virginal, with burning eyes, stood before
him, her hands at her breast.</p>

<p>"Lord, I think it is&mdash;love," she said
again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>"And <em>you</em>," said Zuan&mdash;"<em>you</em> what&mdash;<em>you
are</em>!" But it was not really he
who said that. It was a last faint protest
from the man he once had been.</p>

<p>"Does that matter?" she pleaded, in
an agony, her hands going out to him.</p>

<p>Young Zuan took a great breath.
"God knows it should matter!" he
groaned, "but I cannot make it weigh
with me. Your spell is over my heart
and soul, and I am sick for helpless love
of you. When you touch me I tremble.
When I see your eyes the world
drops from me and I ride upon the stars
breathless in some strange ecstasy. I
have drunk madness before you and I
am mad. No! It does not matter to
me that you are what you are&mdash;the
woman of abomination. I love you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
You and I are bound together with
chains. We cannot live apart."</p>

<p>Then for a time an odd little awkward
silence fell upon them. Once
Zuan put out his arms towards the
woman as if he would take her into
them, but as if moved by a sudden
panic at what she had roused she
shrank back, crying something under
her breath that sounded like, "No,
no!" And presently he moved past
her a few steps down the slope of turf
on which they stood, and straightway
found himself at the brink of the westward
cliff which rose from the water's
edge. He knew where they were&mdash;some
three or four miles north of
the city and on the opposite side
of the narrow island to where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
fight of the night before had taken
place.</p>

<p>"Will you tell me," he said at last,
turning&mdash;it was a certain relief to
break the strain they had been under&mdash;"will
you tell me how we came here?
We are a long way from the fisherman's
hut and the cove where my galley lay."</p>

<p>"A lad helped me with you, lord,"
she said&mdash;"a vine-grower's lad whom
I befriended two days ago. When you
had fallen into the little ravine I found
you there at its bottom, and at first I&mdash;thought
you were dead. You lay
so still! Then I felt your heart beat
and knew you were only stunned. I
tore a strip from my shift and bound
your head with it, for your head was
bleeding." Young Zuan raised a hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
and for the first time discovered that a
bandage was wrapped about his brows.
"Then I waited there with you. I
waited for a long time, climbing the
bank once or twice to see how the fight
above was waging. Not many of your
men were killed, I think&mdash;ten or twelve
perhaps&mdash;those who fought as rear-guard
while the others were swimming
and rowing in skiffs out to the ship&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then they got away?" cried young
Zuan, eagerly. "The galley got safe
away?"</p>

<p>"Yes, lord," she said, "the galley
sailed away, and after a time the Huns&mdash;<em>my</em>
Huns&mdash;went away too towards
the city. When I came out of the
ravine at last there was only one man
left there&mdash;the vine-grower's lad, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
had crept from the wood to see the
fighting. I called to him, and between
us we raised you and brought you here.
You fell asleep without waking from
your swoon."</p>

<p>"They got away!" said young Zuan,
staring with wide, bright eyes across
the strait to where the Velebic cliffs
rose gray and fierce. "They got away!
They'll meet Il Lupo and the other
galleys! They&mdash;" A little restless
movement from the woman made him
turn his head quickly, and the light
faded from his eyes.</p>

<p>"That&mdash;doesn't matter," he said, in
a different tone. "Nothing matters&mdash;now."
He watched her for a long time
under his brows, bitterly at first, but
she was such as no man could look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
coldly upon, and she had saved his life
and gone from triumph into hiding
with him. As he looked at her, Il
Lupo and the galleys dimmed from his
mind.</p>

<p>"What," said he at last, very gently,
"is to become of you and me?"</p>

<p>"I do not know, lord," she said.
"Oh, lord, a woman, when she loves,
does not think of such things or care
for them. She does not look ahead.
A woman, lord, when she loves, has
space in her mind and soul for nothing
but love. You&mdash;do not know women."</p>

<p>"No," said young Zuan, shaking his
head, "I do not know them. That is
true. They&mdash;have never come into
my way."</p>

<p>"I am glad," she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>"Princess," said he, after a little
silence, "it is true, what men say of
you?"</p>

<p>"Does it matter?" she asked again.
"No, lord, it is not true&mdash;at least much
of it is not. But you have said it did
not matter&mdash;you have said so!"</p>

<p>He turned his eyes from the pitifulness
of her face.</p>

<p>"It matters," he said, "only in what
is to become of us. If it is true, we can
never go back to Venice. I must be an
outcast from my city and from my
people."</p>

<p>She crept nearer to him, where they
sat on the cliff's edge, nearer, on her
knees, looking eagerly into his face.</p>

<p>"And, lord," she said, watching
him, "if it is true&mdash;sufficiently true&mdash;would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
you suffer that for my sake?
Would you give up all that to go with
me?"</p>

<p>"How could I do otherwise?" said
young Zuan, simply, and at that the
woman broke into a little sobbing
laugh of joy and triumph and tenderness.</p>

<p>"Oh, lord!" she cried, "that were
love indeed! Oh, lord, I did not know
that there were men so faithful and so
good.</p>

<p>"And yet," she said, presently, as if
in argument with herself&mdash;"yet noble
lords of Venice and of Genoa and of
Naples and of many Italian cities have
married queens and princesses no
better than the Princess Yaga."</p>

<p>"It is not that only," said young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Zuan. "There are many evil women
in high places&mdash;fawned before, bowed
down to&mdash;in Italy; but you have done
one very terrible and shameful thing,
princess, which alone must make you
hated in Venice forever, and must
make marriage between you and me
impossible there."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;do not understand," she said,
wondering.</p>

<p>"You or your brigands," he said,
"carried off from Ragusa Natalia Volutich.
I was to have married her."</p>

<p>The woman screamed, dragging herself
backward over the turf away from
him.</p>

<p>"<em>You&mdash;you</em>," she cried, in a breathless
whisper, her hands at her mouth,&mdash;"<em>you</em>
are&mdash;Zuan&mdash;Gradenigo?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why&mdash;yes!" said he. "I thought
you knew."</p>

<p>She stumbled to her feet, staring and
sobbing.</p>

<p>"Oh, what have I done? What
have I done?" she cried, over and over
again, and she moved still farther away,
staring at him as if he were a ghost
risen against her.</p>

<p>"What have I done?" she whispered.
Then all at once she began a sobbing,
hysterical laugh&mdash;a laugh that shook
all her slim body, like weeping, and it
seemed that she would never have done
with it. She covered her face with her
hands, leaning against a tree which
grew near by, and the fit of endless
laughter swept her like a storm. Young
Zuan watched her under his brows with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
a sort of gloomy resentment. Women,
he had been told by those of experience,
were creatures of strange and incomprehensible
moods, ruled, like a horse,
by divers vagaries and not at all by
reason. This mad fit of hysteria was,
he took it, therefore to be endured as
patiently as might be, but he had small
store of patience.</p>

<p>"Oh, lord," said the woman, presently,
gasping between her fits of
laughter, tears in her eyes&mdash;"lord,
there is a thing which I must tell you&mdash;an
amazing thing. I do not know
whether you will be glad or angry of it.
In any case I must tell you at once&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait!" said Zuan, and held up a
hand. "I must know first about this
maid, Natalia Volutich, whom you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
stole away. What have you done with
her, princess?" His tone was very
grave and stern.</p>

<p>"The maid Natalia," said she, "has
been well treated, lord. She has come
to no harm. If this war had not arisen
she would have been sent back safely
to her father before now."</p>

<p>"Unharmed?" said Zuan Gradenigo,
watching the woman's eyes.</p>

<p>"Unharmed, lord," she said. "A
maid, as she came. Indeed"&mdash;there
seemed to be a glimmer of a smile at
the woman's lips&mdash;"indeed, I think
she has not been unhappy, this Natalia
of Ragusa. I think she has learned to
feel a certain fondness for her mistress.
I think she would serve her in any way
she could." The smile was a wry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
smile now. "Even so vile a thing as I,
lord," said the woman of abomination,
"can be tender and&mdash;faithful. Even
so vile a thing as I is sometimes loved.
An evil woman, Messer Zuan, is not all
evil. There is something of good in the
very lowest."</p>

<p>"Princess! Princess!" cried the man.</p>

<p>"And now," she said, "I must tell
you what must be told; but, lord, before
I tell it will you say to me once
more what you have said&mdash;that for my
sake, to be with me alone, you stand
willing&mdash;nay, glad&mdash;to give up your
city and your rank and your friends?
Will you say to me that I, woman of infamy
though men call me, am dearer
to you than everything else in the
world?" She came close to him, putting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
out her two hands upon his breast,
and her great eyes burned up into his,
and her face seemed for the instant to
sharpen, to pale, and her lips trembled.</p>

<p>"Will you tell me once again?" she
said, pleading.</p>

<p>"I could not&mdash;live without you&mdash;child,"
he said, and she cried out with
joy at the name. He had called her
"child" on the night before when he
did not know who she was.</p>

<p>She stood away from him at arm's-length.</p>

<p>"Now then, at last," she said, "I will
tell you what you must know. Lord,
I&mdash;" Her voice failed suddenly as if
she had been stricken ill, and all the
rosy color which had risen to her
cheeks began to die slowly away. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
seemed to be staring over young
Zuan's shoulder towards the north.
She raised her hand a little way, but
it dropped again weakly by her side.
"The&mdash;ships!" she said, in a strained
whisper. "The&mdash;ships!" Zuan turned
to look.</p>

<p>Round a little wooded point of the
island, scarcely more than a mile to the
north of where they stood, came, before
the wind, three great Venetian galleys,
looming high and stately in that narrow
strait.</p>

<p>Zuan gave a great shout. "My
ships!" he cried. "My galleys!" His
voice ran up into an odd falsetto note
which was almost a scream. "Trapani
has found Il Lupo, and they are going
to attack the city by sea!" He sprang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
for his cloak, which lay near, as if he
would wave it to attract the attention
of those on the galleys, but the woman
caught him by the arm, white-faced
and breathless.</p>

<p>"No, no!" she cried, swiftly. "No!
You&mdash;must not go. They must not
attack&mdash;now. The city could be taken
in an hour. Those men&mdash;fools! fools!&mdash;of
ours have destroyed the&mdash;engines
of defence. They did not know how to
use them. And they have&mdash;sunk the
ships in the harbor. Lord, you must
not let your ships attack. We must
not lose the city. Oh, it would be
cruel, cruel!" She clung to his arms,
sobbing, panic-stricken, stumbling desperately
over her words.</p>

<p>"Lord, they must not take Arbe!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
she wailed. "All we have done&mdash;all <em>I</em>
have done&mdash;gone for nothing&mdash;nothing!
It is not to be borne. Stop
them, lord! You would not be so cruel
as to allow this. You do not know&mdash;Oh,
stop them! Stop them!" She
was quite beside herself with terror, but
Zuan put her out away from him at
arm's-length and held her there.</p>

<p>"Listen!" he said, sharply. "Listen
to me!"</p>

<p>And her wild incoherence checked itself&mdash;dropped
into breathless sobbing.</p>

<p>"I cannot stop those galleys," he
said. "They have come here to retake
Arbe, which you seized from us,
and if what you say is true they will
take it easily. Remember, nothing I
can do will save the city for you. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
city is lost to you already. You must
let me signal to the galleys and go on
board. You must let me lead this
force in the attack, as I was to have
done when I left Venice."</p>

<p>The woman cried out upon him again
in a panic, but he quieted her sharply as
before, speaking in quick, emphatic
words as one speaks to a terrified
child.</p>

<p>"You must let me go!" he said.
"Surely you see that my honor is in
this. Whether I go or stay here in
hiding, the result will be the same for
the city, but if I do not go I am dishonored
for life. You would be hurt
by that as much as I, so let me go. If
I retake the city, the council in Venice
will perhaps allow me to marry you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
without banishment. At any rate,
there is the bare chance of it. Let me
go!"</p>

<p>She stood away from him, drooping,
downcast eyes averted, and she made
an odd little despairing gesture&mdash;as it
were of defeat. Arbe went from her
hands in that gesture. Triumph was
renounced that her lover's honor might
rest unstained.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said&mdash;"yes, you must go,
lord. I will not dishonor you. But
oh, if there is a God who hears lovers'
prayers, I pray that he will not let you
come to harm. If you are killed this
day I shall not live."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 395px;">
<a id="img4"><img src="images/b_105.jpg" width="395" height="600" alt="decorative image" /></a>
</div>

<p>The ships were drawing nearer, down
the coast of the island.</p>

<p>"I shall be," said the woman of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
abomination, "in the city, lord, when
you take it." She smiled again her
wry smile, as if something grimly
amused her.</p>

<p>"No!" said he. "Wait here or in
the wood north of the Land Gate. I
will come for you. You must not put
yourself in danger."</p>

<p>"I shall be in the city, lord," she said
again, "but not in danger. Oh, I pray
God to keep you safe!"</p>

<p>"I must go," said he, looking over
his shoulder at the three high galleys.
"I must go, but oh, my dear, never
doubt me! I shall come to you if I
have to crawl on hands and knees!"
He took her into his arms and kissed
her mouth. It was the first time.
Then he caught up his mantle and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
stood, sharply outlined on the brink of
the cliff, waving it about his head, until
through the still morning air he heard
cries from the men of the nearest ship
and saw that he had attracted their
attention.</p>

<p>Near where he stood a fissure rent
the wall of rock&mdash;a watercourse half
filled with earth and shale and grown
up with low shrubs. Down this he
made his way, plunging recklessly
among bowlders, and so reached the
tiny strip of beach at the cliff's foot.
The first galley was already hove to,
and from it a skiff put out to take him
aboard. In ten minutes more the
three ships bore away again southward,
and Zuan Gradenigo was in
command.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>And, after all, they had very little
fighting for their pains&mdash;too little to
please them. For it seems that an
hour before the three ships came into
sight of the city the Venetians and
Arbesani of the garrison, too carelessly
guarded by their barbarian captors,
rose, in street and market-place and
improvised prison&mdash;rose at a preconcerted
signal&mdash;and fell upon the Huns
tooth and nail. Some of them had
weapons, some sticks or stones, one&mdash;an
Arbesan called Spalatini, and
his name deserves to go down in history
along with Messer Samson's&mdash;the
thigh-bone of an ox which the Huns
had killed and roasted whole in the
Via Venezia.</p>

<p>When, therefore, the three galleys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
under Zuan Gradenigo drew into the
harbor and hurriedly made fast to the
landing-place, a running hand-to-hand
fight was in progress from one end of
the city to the other. It was not a
battle, for it had no organization whatever.
It was a disgraceful m&ecirc;l&eacute;e.
Naturally enough the Venetian reinforcements
incontinently decided the
day. Something over three hundred
of the ban's barbarians&mdash;Huns, Slavs,
and Croats&mdash;gave themselves up.
Nearly two hundred killed themselves
by leaping over the high westward sea-wall,
and a hundred more were killed
in fight or escaped by water. It
was an inglorious ending to a matter
which had promised so fine a
struggle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>An hour after the landing, as soon as
ever his duties gave him a moment's
breathing space, young Zuan made up
the Via Venezia&mdash;that single long
street which runs north and south
through the city&mdash;to the castle which
sits at the street's northern end, and
under which is the Land Gate, the only
means of entering the town except by
sea.</p>

<p>In the loggia of the castle he came
upon the count&mdash;Jacopo Corner&mdash;a
round old man with a red face, gouty,
so that he went upon crutches. At
this moment he was surrounded by a
group of gentlemen&mdash;Arbesani for the
most part, heads of the city's great
families&mdash;De Dominis, Galzigna, Nemira,
Zudeneghi, and such; but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
turned from them to greet young
Gradenigo.</p>

<p>"Ah, Zuan, my lad!" he cried out,
"you come in the nick of time&mdash;you
and your archers! You've saved the
day, for those dogs were just getting
the better of us. Another hour and&mdash;St.
Mark!&mdash;our heads would have been
on pike-staves!"</p>

<p>Young Zuan struggled to preserve a
face of civil sympathy, but his eyes
were upon the open doors beyond.
Old Jacopo seemed to read his thought.</p>

<p>"Ay, we have the queen bee in there!
She's in my private audience-chamber,
bound to a chair. Queen bee, say I?
Hussy! Strumpet! Daughter of abomination!
Mother of sins!" He shook
a crutch at the bronze doors. "Ay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
she's there!" he said. "But the wench
has cheated us, for all that. She has
robbed me of the pleasure of tearing
her evil bones apart&mdash;alive, that
is."</p>

<p>Gradenigo, one hand on the door,
turned slowly backward a masklike
face. He felt that he was shaking and
swaying like a drunken man.</p>

<p>"What do you&mdash;mean?" he said, in
a flat voice.</p>

<p>Old Jacopo hobbled nearer and
touched the younger man's arm. "Eh,
lad!" he croaked. "Come! come!
You're not yourself. The sun has got
to you. You've a bound-up head, I
see. Better have a rest!"</p>

<p>"What was it you said?" asked
young Gradenigo, looking down at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
ground, which swung slowly back and
forth under him.</p>

<p>"Yaga?" said old Jacopo. "Oh,
she's dead. The wanton's dead. She
got a serving-maid to stab her while
she sat bound in her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Out of my way!" said young Zuan,
in a great voice of agony, and he
dashed the old man aside and sprang
through the half-open doors of the
castle.</p>

<p>He knew where the private audience-room
was, and ran there at speed. No
soldier stood on guard at the door&mdash;all
had been engaged in that hand-to-hand
street-fight through the city. He
tore the door open and reeled into the
room, then closed it behind him and
stood with his back against it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>The room was oddly like that room
in the doge's palace where he had sat
with his uncle two days since in Venice.
The same great, carved table stood near
the centre. The same high-set windows
let in bars of colored light, which
slanted down through the dimness and
lay across floor and furniture in billets
and lozenges of gules and vert and
azure.</p>

<p>A single red beam rested upon the
bared shoulder of the woman who hung
drooping from her bonds, in the count's
great chair of state; but lower, from
between the woman's breasts, a darker
red had coursed a downward trickling
stream, and, still lower, made a red
pool in the woman's lap. Her head,
bent, with chin on breast, was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
shadow, but out of the shadow two
eyes, still half-open, gleamed with the
shallow, dull opacity of death.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 401px;">
<a id="HUNG"><img src="images/i_098fp.jpg" width="401" height="600" alt="" /></a>
<div class="caption">SHE HUNG DROOPING IN THE GREAT CHAIR OF STATE</div>
</div>

<p>Young Zuan, shaking against his
closed door, gave a dry sob.</p>

<p>"Child! Child!" he mourned, bitterly.
Then, all at once, his eyes narrowed
in an alert frown. There was
something strange here.</p>

<p>He crossed the room with swift steps
and dropped upon one knee before the
chair of state, staring close through the
half-darkness.</p>

<p>This was a woman, beautiful indubitably,
but no longer young. Her
bared shoulders were thick and mature,
the breast under them mature, too. On
her bent face lust and hatred and
cupidity and all evil passions had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
graven marks that not even death
could erase.</p>

<p>Ay! something strange here. Young
Zuan's foot struck against a yielding
body which lay under the heavy
shadow of the table. It was another
woman, and dead also, lying upon her
face. Gradenigo turned the body over
with panic in his heart. A squat,
broad-jowled, peasant face&mdash;the serving-maid,
it would seem, who had done
her mistress that last service and
straightway followed to serve elsewhere.</p>

<p>Zuan rose to his feet frowning. The
matter was quite beyond him. Then
one stirred in the shadows at the far
end of the room, and very slowly his
princess came to him through those
bars of colored light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>"Child! Child!" he cried again, and
tears rolled down over his cheeks. He
put out shaking arms to her, but she
held him away with one hand, saying
only:</p>

<p>"Wait, lord!"</p>

<p>Young Zuan swung about towards
the dead woman who drooped so
heavily in her bonds.</p>

<p>"Who is&mdash;that who sits there dead?"
he asked. "Corner told me it was the
Princess Yaga. Some one has lied to
him. Who is it?"</p>

<p>She gave a quick sob.</p>

<p>"Lord, it is the Princess Yaga," she
said.</p>

<p>"But," said he, dropping his voice to
a whisper&mdash;he did not know why&mdash;"but
<em>you&mdash;you</em>?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>"Natalia Volutich, lord!" she said,
whispering, too.</p>

<p>Young Zuan put up a hand to his
bandaged head, and he drew the hand
across his eyes. His eyes were bewildered,
hurt&mdash;like a child's eyes before
some great mystery.</p>

<p>"I do not understand," he said, just
as a child would say it.</p>

<p>"Lord," cried the maid, with little
sobs between her words, "I&mdash;did it
first&mdash;I pretended to be Yaga first, for&mdash;duty's
sake&mdash;the duty I owed to her.
She had been good to me, lord, kind and
loving. When your lieutenant thought
I was Yaga and begged you to set sail
with me, leaving Arbe, I saw that it
would give her time&mdash;time to strengthen
the&mdash;defences. So I lied. I did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
not&mdash;care what became of me if only
<em>she</em> was&mdash;safe. Then&mdash;then you were
in&mdash;danger and&mdash;oh, lord, I had looked
into your eyes! I had&mdash;There was
never man like you. I&mdash;loved you
from the first moment&mdash;the very first
moment. I could not bear that you
should die. So I&mdash;saved you. Lord,
do you not understand? What I did
I did for love's sake. This morning
when I found who you were I tried to
tell you the truth. I tried, lord, did I
not? Did I not? Oh!" she cried, turning
from him with wringing hands, "I
have done everything ill and you will
never forgive me; and yet, lord, I did it
all for love's sake!"</p>

<p>She looked towards Zuan Gradenigo,
but he stood silent and helpless in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
place, his eyes staring, his lips apart.
The thing had been too swift and too
amazing for him. His mind, unused to
indirections, labored blindly at sea.
And so, after a moment, she turned
away again and crossed the room to
where the dead woman hung, lax and
heavy, in the carven chair. Sobbing,
she dropped upon her knees before the
chair and laid her forehead against the
dead woman's arm, into whose soft
flesh the leathern thongs had cut so
cruelly.</p>

<p>"And I was away when they bound
you!" she wept. "I was not with you
when you died!"</p>

<p>Zuan Gradenigo awoke from his
daze.</p>

<p>"Child!" he cried. "Child! Come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
away from that vile body. It pollutes
you!"</p>

<p>But the maid turned fiercely upon
him.</p>

<p>"She loved me!" cried the maid.
"She was kind to me, gentle and pitiful&mdash;and
I let her die alone! Whatever
she may have been to others, to me,
lord, she was like the mother who died
when I was a little babe. She loved
me, and I let her die miserably, alone
here! Oh, lord, have you nothing but
curses for a woman who is dead and
cannot answer you?"</p>

<p>Zuan bent his head. "Child," said
he, gravely, "I ask your forgiveness,
and hers, and God's. She was kind to
you, wherefore I shall never speak ill of
her again. But oh, my dear, come to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
me! She is dead and you cannot comfort
her now. Come to me, child, who
am alive and cannot live without you."</p>

<p>"Oh, lord," said she, "I would not
have you try!"</p>


<p class="end">THE END</p>
